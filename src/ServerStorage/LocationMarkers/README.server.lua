Hey! To use this system, either place the loader in Workspace or ServerScriptService or
just move IndicatorsClient to StarterPlayer > StarterPlayerScripts

To create new indicators, you can either copy existing ones or:
- Create a new Attachment
- Add an attribute "Color" of type Color3
- Add an attribute "Enabled" of type boolean
- Add an attribute "Image" of type string
- Add an attribute "Team" of type BrickColor
Done!

To customize indicators, change the attributes: "Color" and "Image":
- Color is the color of the arrow and the background circle
- Image is the icon that goes in the middle of the circle. It's automatically rounded.
There are also attributes "Enabled" and "Team":
- Enabled turns on and off the indicator. Check the box to turn it on.
- Team makes it so only one team can see the indicator. Change it to the BrickColor of 
  the team.
  
That's my bit!
